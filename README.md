# AthleticSwiftUI
Implement click events on the articles in the ArticlesViewController so that:
Selecting an item in the Articles list opens a new, non-modal view, that is pushed on to the navigation stack


## The new view should:
* Displaying the content of the “imageUrlString” from the Article model at the top of the view
* Display the article title underneath (or over) the ImageView
* Display all of the article “body” content underneath the Image/Title

## Bonus
This project is a starting point for interview candidates to display technical skills and design creativity.

* Add a filter function and UI to filter articles by League
* Add another filter function and UI to filter articles by Authors
